# Strata Runtimes

This repository hosts **prebuilt runtime artifacts** for the [Strata](https://github.com/Jadevit/strata) project.  
These include CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, and Metal builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  

Artifacts are automatically built and published by the Strata CI pipeline, and are pulled directly by the Strata installer.  

⚠️ This repository is not intended for manual use. If you’re looking for the main Strata source code, go [here](https://github.com/Jadevit/strata).
